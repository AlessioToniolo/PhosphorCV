# PhosphorCV

## Welcome
This is PhosphorCV, a machine learning library for First Tech Challenge teams.
PhosphorCV uses the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) ml platform and integrates
it into capabilities for FTC robot.

### Machine Learning Abilities
- Supervised learning object detection neural network that requires no determination
algorithims, leading to simple reuse for every game.
- Cache & boundary box machine learning odometer algorithim using static in game objects.

## Getting Started
**Coming Soon!**
